## cygwin bootstrap

An extremely hacky way of setting up Cygwin the way I like it.  Developed by someone who has no idea how to use PowerShell.

## why?

I have to use Windows computers with deep-freeze at college often.  I *could* bring a flash drive with a *nix system or Cygwin already set up, 
but I always forget them.

## what i learned

PowerShell sucks.
